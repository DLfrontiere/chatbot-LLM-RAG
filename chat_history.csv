what about nvidia culitho,"Nvidia Culitho is a new library that supercharges computational lithography, a significant computational workload in chip design and manufacturing. It is part of Nvidia's suite of acceleration libraries, which solve new challenges and open up new markets by connecting to applications across various industries. Nvidia now offers around 300 acceleration libraries, including Culitho.","our body of work nvidia pioneered accelerated computing to tackle challenges no one else can solve. our work in ai and the metaverse is profoundly impacting society and transforming the world’s largest industries—from gaming to robotics, self-driving cars to life-saving healthcare, climate change to virtual worlds where we can all connect and create. jason o'rear pioneering accelerated computing accelerated computing requires full-stack optimization, from chip architecture, systems, and acceleration libraries, to refactoring the applications. the global nvidia ecosystem spans 4 million developers, 40,000 companies, and over 3,000 applications. application frameworks platform nvidia nvidia omniverse ai rtx

minuti credit: synthesia synthesia, startup britannica di intelligenza artificiale, ha presentato una serie di aggiornamenti che trasformano la sua piattaforma in una suite completa di produzione video per grandi aziende. tra le novità più interessanti, spicca la possibilità di generare avatar ai personalizzati utilizzando semplicemente la webcam di un computer o lo smartphone. questa funzionalità, che richiede meno di cinque minuti di registrazione, rappresenta un notevole passo avanti rispetto al precedente processo che richiedeva la presenza fisica in uno studio di registrazione. synthesia ha inoltre introdotto avatar a corpo intero, dotati di mani e braccia, ampliando così le possibilità creative per gli utenti. altre innovazioni sono lo strumento di registrazione dello schermo con avatar ai che guidano l’utente attraverso presentazioni o tutorial, la possibilità di clonare la propria voce per far parlare gli avatar in diverse lingue e un assistente video ai in grado di produrre riassunti di articoli e documenti. una valutazione da miliardo di dollari l’anno scorso, synthesia ha raccolto 90 milioni di dollari in un round di finanziamento – cui ha partecipato anche nvidia – che l’ha valutata 1 miliardo di dollari, confermando l’interesse degli investitori per questa tecnologia. la società offre diversi piani di abbonamento, da quelli base a 22 dollari fino a soluzioni enterprise personalizzate, posizionandosi come un player significativo nel crescente mercato della produzione video basata sull’intelligenza artificiale. avatar mercato synthesia articoli simili youtuber ucraina ‘clonata’ dall’ai cinese: i suoi deepfake sono russi gli avatar generati dall'ai si spacciavano per donne russe che parlano
