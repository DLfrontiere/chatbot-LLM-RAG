            "Answer: Over time, bottom bracket components can become loose, leading to accelerated wear on the bearings and cup surfaces. Proper maintenance is important to extend the lifetime of bottom bracket components. In the case of one-piece bottom brackets, an overhaul may be needed if the bearings inside are damaged or if the cup races are worn. For three-piece bottom brackets, components may become worn and loose over time, requiring cleaning and replacement if necessary. Cartridge bottom brackets may need to be replaced entirely when the bearings are worn out.\n",
